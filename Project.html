		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<h3>Topic</h3>
		<p>Our proposed project is for an automatic household aquarium climate control system which is modular in nature. This device contains a central control hub computer equipped with a user interface to operate a set of tools. The modular design allows the user to customise and fit the instruments to their specific tankâ€™s requirements for maintenance and automation. Hence, its utility is broad and allows it to operate for a multitude of different kinds of fish species. As previously mentioned, the control hub is the access port for the user to setup the aquarium to their specific needs via software, we plan on developing. Included in the software is a system that lets you track your aquariums and fish individually and make changes if needed. This program also includes information and instructions on how best to take care of the myriad of species catalogued within the software. By using this setup users will likely no longer have to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Maintain correct temperature within the tank
			</p><li><p>Manually feed the fish (However refilling feeding reservoirs will be required)
			</p><li><p>Adjust pH levels manually
			</p><li><p>Manage water levels (against evaporation)
			</p><li><p>Test and adjust chemical concentrations
			</p><li><p>Apply correct lighting per species requirement
			</p>
		<p>Its intention is to electronically streamline the tedious, complicated, and time-consuming processes of fish care, while also enabling users with applicable upkeep instructions. Granted a successful development stage, the result would have users able to appropriately care for their fish with applicable information, suitable food, and a healthy habitat for the fish to thrive.
