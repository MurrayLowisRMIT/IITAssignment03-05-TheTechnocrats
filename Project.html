		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<h3>Topic</h3>
		<p>Our proposed project is for an automatic household aquarium climate control system which is modular in nature. This device contains a central control hub computer equipped with a user interface to operate a set of tools. The modular design allows the user to customise and fit the instruments to their specific tank’s requirements for maintenance and automation. Hence, its utility is broad and allows it to operate for a multitude of different kinds of fish species. As previously mentioned, the control hub is the access port for the user to setup the aquarium to their specific needs via software, we plan on developing. Included in the software is a system that lets you track your aquariums and fish individually and make changes if needed. This program also includes information and instructions on how best to take care of the myriad of species catalogued within the software. By using this setup users will likely no longer have to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Maintain correct temperature within the tank
			</p><li><p>Manually feed the fish (However refilling feeding reservoirs will be required)
			</p><li><p>Adjust pH levels manually
			</p><li><p>Manage water levels (against evaporation)
			</p><li><p>Test and adjust chemical concentrations
			</p><li><p>Apply correct lighting per species requirement
			</p>
		</ul>
		<p>Its intention is to electronically streamline the tedious, complicated, and time-consuming processes of fish care, while also enabling users with applicable upkeep instructions. Granted a successful development stage, the result would have users able to appropriately care for their fish with applicable information, suitable food, and a healthy habitat for the fish to thrive.
		</p>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
		<p>The objective for this project is to mitigate the struggles faced by novice aquarium owners and minimize the chances their tanks become a watery grave. For experts, this project will provide the convenience of automating the more tedious tasks. Most people that obtain fish and an aquarium do so without fully comprehending the extensive responsibilities and intricacies of nurturing fish successfully.
		</p><p>Installing a filter and filling the tank with tap water seems simple enough, but only the more researched owners would be aware of the risks such little effort endorses. Fish can be extremely sensitive to environments that are unnatural to them, hence why slight temperature changes is often enough to kill them. Informing new aquarium owners of the proper methods to care for their scaly friends is likely the most important aspect of this technology. Informing them, step 1. Automating the work, step 2. This seems to be the most direct way for us to achieve our goal of limiting unnecessary fish stress or fatalities.
		</p><p>The automation in turn protects the species housed within, as owner unreliability and ignorance are much less likely to cause significant harm or death to the fish. Fish are usually able to live healthily for several years but their natural life expectancy is very often cut short due to poor tank management or ignorant owners. This device goes a long way in mitigating these issues. It is no secret that aquarium holders often neglect the laborious task of changing water, managing correct chemical balance, or maintaining correct temperature. It is also common for owners to introduce incompatible species to their tank putting all the fish in danger. Managing pH levels is another good example of a precise and complicated procedure to get right, and if not done correctly is one of the largest causes in fish death.
		</p><p>We believe technology is at its best when used as a means to an end, and thus our ultimate goal is to modernize the laborious nature of fish raising and to counter futile fish mortality.
		</p>
		<h3>Landscape</h3>
		<p>Looking at the state of modern electronic aquarium setups the biggest competitor and closest product to our own design would be the GHL Profilux 4 Aquarium Controller.
		</p><p>Similarly, to our own ambitions this device also contains modular connections for varied aquarium configurations. These connections can handle temperature, pH levels, lighting, feeders, and water level monitors. The companion application, GHL Connect App, allows the user to individually fine tune the complex attributes of an aquarium arrangement. Due to its inherently complicated and fiddly design this device is purely marketed toward aquarium experts and budding aquarists. As stated in their tagline “The ProfiLux® aquarium controller offers everything the ambitious aquarist needs to achieve success”.
		</p><p>A key difference to note is the method of using the devices. The GHL Profilux 4 requires a separate companion application operational through a smartphone or computer linked on the same network to control, whereas our Robo Reef if directly controllable via a central control hub computer accessible via a user interface as well as a companion port application to fit the users convenience. The interactive encyclopaedia housed within the Robo Reef is another important distinction between the two. The GHL Profilux 4 assumes the users understanding of the fish or at the very least expects them to have already completed prior research before modifying the particulars. The Robo Reef, however, makes no assumptions about the customers awareness and provides the relevant information thus making the device safe to use and optimal from the very day a new fish arrives.
		</p><p>With such opposing marketing strategies, we believe there is still a hefty market for the Robo Reef to capitalise on. As previously mentioned, the Robo Reef’s design is to appeal to the fish raising novice by providing extensive species information and streamlining the alterations. Combining the fish requirement details with the ability to make quick and automated modifications encourages beginner clients to sustain a healthy habitat for all within.

		<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
		<h3>Aims</h3>
		<p>The ultimate deliverable for this project will be to release a mostly autonomous, modular climate control system for household aquariums. The minimum amount of progress required to consider version 1.0 viable would be for the central control hub computer to be operational, have a simple user interface, and support a limited list of fundamental instruments.

				</ul>
		</ul>
		<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
		<h4>Inception and Overview</h4>
		<p>The conception of this project was first born from Murray’s experience with caring for personal aquariums and all the problems faced on the path to successful care and management. As a group, The Technocrats decided this would be the perfect scenario to take advantage of the global knowledge pool and automation techniques made available through modern IT.
		</p><p>The original proposal for this project was just a simple all-in-one premade tank with a built-in set of instruments to suit a rigid, restricted single use case. This model was ultimately deemed insufficient on the grounds that there is already a multitude of prebuilt aquariums on the market (many of which enable woefully inadequate levels of care), and to an uninformed novice this would just appear to be an unnecessarily convoluted alternative (“Why should I pay $200 for all these extra doohickies when the $20 one says it does the same thing?”).
		</p><p>Furthermore a single setup would never be able to accommodate the different needs all of the different species kept in modern aquariums or satisfy the varying practical and aesthetic requirements of aquarium owners (“How am I supposed to keep seahorses in a tank with a filter current too strong for them?” or “I need a tank that can fit on my small living room table”).
		</p><p>The solution to these problems was to adopt a modular design built around a universal control hub. This will allow the user to mix and match the components for their tank to suit whatever their use case may be, whether a tiny filter and heater set up for a single betta fish or a sprawling, room filling system comprising multiple sub-climates and a self-contained ecosystem.
		</p><p>Providing the right tools however is only half the job, they become useless without an understanding of how and when to use them. For this reason, the project will include a digital encyclopaedia covering everything from species needs to aquarium set up tutorials which will allow the user to make informed decisions every step of the way. Since this information obviously needs to be made available before purchasing everything, this software will be made available as part of a free companion app.
		</p><p>After the now-informed user has established their new aquarium using the modules advised for their designed setup, ongoing maintenance of the aquarium would then be managed by micro controller. The micro controller (Arduino modified) would host a Linux operating system modify to act as a web server for the application allowing local non-internet access or via our web portal. This allows our users to utilize any device to setup and manage your aquarium. The ideal use would be through phone so you can utilize your camera to add sensors via our QR input method.
		</p><p>Initially Bluetooth connectivity was considered to connect the app and hub, however this was decided against due several issues with the Bluetooth environment. These flaws include the need for physical proximity which would mean make the monitoring functions of the app redundant but would also would not allow the user to receive alerts and send intervening commands when not nearby. Bluetooth is also often susceptible to interference and can at times be temperamental.
		</p>

		<h4>How it All Works</h4>
		<p>The entire system is centred around the main hub device which controls how every other part of the system operates, taking inputs from the user, dictating the functions of connected modules and providing feedback to the user when requested or when their attention is required.
		</p><p>The user interface for the hub computer will be via a responsive web application hosted on the hub computer, this can be accessed locally offline via a static IP address or online through our website, the prototype layout for which can be found in the "Project Artifacts' section. The functions performed by the various instruments within the tank will be controlled by the hub computer based on the inputs given by the user, who will in turn be advised by the built-in digital encyclopaedia and tutorials. The hub will continuously monitor the conditions within the aquarium by taking the readings from the connected sensors and comparing these against thresholds defined user input. When thresholds are exceeded, the software vary its output to the relevant instrument to modify its behaviour, for instance reducing power output to the heater if the thermometer reading exceeds the maximum allowable temperature. If no relevant instrument has been installed into the system, it will instead send an alert to the user via an onscreen notification, playing repeated warning ‘beeps’ to catch the user’s attention, and sending a push notification to the companion app if the user is using it. 
		</p><p>The built in digital encyclopaedia will include searchable details for a wide range of fish, plant, and other aquatic species, tutorials for the establishment and management of their current aquarium and other aquarium types, and other relevant information such as the handling of disease outbreaks or pest infestations.
		</p><p>Should the user opt to register their system online, they will be able to take advantage of the companion app to control and monitor the aquarium remotely. The companion app will run a similar version of the project software built into the hub computer but will function as a virtual instance of the hub computer. Rather than controlling the tank instruments directly, the app will relay hub readings to the user and user inputs to the hub which will then modify instrument operations.
		</p><p>This online system will take the form of a dedicated server to record user preferences, relay aquarium conditions to the user on any given device, and remotely manage the hub’s output the tank instruments.
		</p><p>As for the physical instruments that make up the modular components of this system, early development will be focussed on the simpler and more ubiquitous instruments. This will include thermometers, heaters, feeders, lights, and filters.
		</p><p>Digital thermometers will be wall mounted within the body of the aquarium and connected directly to the hub via the connection ports. The temperature readings will be taken as an input by the hub computer and the readings made available to the user. This input will also be used by the hub to regulate the output provided to heaters if they have been included in the tank. The heaters output will be increased, decreased, or unchanged depending on whether the current temperature is below, above, or equal to the target temperature set by the user. The heaters themselves can be made available in several varieties including wall mounted, under-tank, or under-substrate. For larger setups, multiple heaters and thermometers can be used to unify temperature or to manage areas separately throughout the tank if desired.
		</p><p>Lights will be available in several varieties and sizes to account for tank needs. Variants will include basic white, UV light, and full spectrum lighting and be available in top mounted, suspended, or boom arm varieties. All lights will be LEDs for durability, efficiency, and safety. The lights will all be controlled by the timer built into the hub computer which will allow the user to set daily schedules with additional options to simulate natural sunrise and sunset or other ambient options such as thunderstorms and cloud movements which can be relaxing to both the fish and owners.
		</p><p>Different types of filters will make up the final category of the ‘core’ instruments. The range of filters made available will include wall-mounted, under-gravel, and waterfall variants. The appropriate types for a given tank will be dictated by the species as laid out by the encyclopaedia, passive fish such as bettas for instance do better with the still water enabled by under-gravel filters, whereas certain tetras prefer a mild current that can be achieved with waterfall filters. For more advanced use cases, the hub computer will provide options scheduled outages or intermittent use such as in heavily planted tanks where a moderate degree of suspended biomatter can be advantageous.
		</p><p>Once the core instruments have been satisfactorily finalised and implemented, further development can then turn toward secondary modules to expand functionality and add quality of life features. This will include automatic feeders, aerators (both independent and those that work in tandem with filters), water level monitors and controllable release reservoirs, and an assortment of water chemistry sensors or regulators to manage parameters such as pH, nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, general hardness and carbonate hardness.
		</p><p>Aerators are relatively simple devices, though come in several varieties and are not always necessary in many aquarium types, hence their relegation to secondary instruments within the scope of this project. The types that would be considered include air-stones, waterfall aerators, and other surface disturbing impeller varieties. Most aerators can simply be set for continuous operation, however certain use cases may require operation at reduced or intermittent intensity due to factors such as a reduced water level causing over-oxygenation by waterfall aerators (which can cause health issues such as gas bubble disease). These constraints would be handled by the hub computer. Many aerator variants would also be able to work in tandem with filters, passing impelled water through the filter before discharging.
		</p><p>Automatic feeders as a concept are quite straightforward, however due to the drastic differences between the different types of food and requisite release mechanisms this has been outlined as a secondary feature for now. The eventual implementation for these will incorporate mechanisms allowing feeders to handle food types including flakes, pellets, freeze dried livestock, liquids and fertilisers for plants, and potentially live food such as brine shrimp. These would need to be kept stocked and checked for freshness manually by the owner and a release schedule entered into the hub computer.
		</p><p>The various water chemistry sensors will likely be among the most complicated mechanisms to implement within the scope of this project due to their often-complex operation. Most commonly chemistry tests are conducted via manual chemical mixing and observation, whereas an automated system would likely require a repeatable, digitised approach such as custom developed sensor rods.  For this reason, chemical sensors (and therefore also their corresponding mechanical regulators) have been set aside for later research and development. Once developed and implemented however, the sensors would run continuous or regular tests, feeding results back to the hub computer for processing and then releasing chemicals via the regulator mechanisms to correct water chemistry as required.

		<h4>Progress to date and future development</h4>
		<p>At the time of submission for this report on August 23rd, project development has been primarily exploratory and conceptual. While the timeline for development has been outlined, the tangible assets created include the pseudo code for the hub and companion app software which was created using various webtools such as figma.com and lucidchart.com as featured in the ‘Project Artifacts’ section. While the software itself has not yet been developed, a limited number of entries for the digital encyclopaedia have been created for demonstration purposes.
		</p>

		<h3>Roles</h3>
		<h4>Head Ops Manager - Murray</h4>
		<p>As the head of operations, Murray manages the overall goal of the project. The role requires him to manage and define roles related to labour, productivity, quality control, and safety measures. Along with analysing team operations, he is required to prepare and evaluate annual budgets, initiating corrective actions where necessary. While overseeing the overall vision of the project, the Ops manager must also have a deep understanding of the technical aspects and be able to communicate with the Development team on this level. Every project requires a leader to define and keep the team focussed, this encapsulates the Head Ops Manager position.
		</p>
		<h4>Ops Assistant Manager - Ossama</h4>
		<p>As the Ops Assistant, Ossama works directly with the Head Ops manager. The main responsibilities of the Ops assistant are to aid the Ops Manager with daily tasks, recommend improvements to the project, liaise with different departments, and monitor cash flow and budgets. As a general manager of the project, excellent communication is expected in every facet of his job.
		</p>
		<h4>Dev Ops Manager - Tyson</h4>
		<p>As the Dev Ops Manager, Tyson oversees Software Development within the project. This crucial position requires Tyson to communicate with the development team, defining specific roles, and monitoring productivity. As a manager, Tyson will work closely with the Head Ops Manager to examine and adjust operational logistics where necessary.
		</p>
		<h4>Technology and Hardware Research Analyst - Torin</h4>
		<p>As a Research Analyst, Torin is required to explore technology and hardware options and consider which elements will be most useful for the project. He is expected to research, analyse, interpret, and present findings to the Ops manager. It is imperative for the research analyst to communicate relevant information to the Dev Ops manager, coordinating software and hardware requirements of the project.
		</p>
		<h4>Market and Technical Researcher - Marcus</h4>
		<p>As a Market and Technical Researcher, Marcus works closely with Torin to explore technological routes for which the project will take. His position will aid the team in acquiring knowledge of relevant technology and competitors within the scope of the project. Marcus will be required to prepare and present research reports to the Dev Ops manager and Ops Manager.
		</p>
		<h4>Compliance Testing and Risk Analyst - Joe</h4>
		<p>The Compliance Analyst will be required to evaluate risks with the products developed from the project through thorough and controlled testing. Joe will be required to develop and coordinate testing parameters, interpret data, and present the findings to the Ops Manager. Joe is expected to make suggestions based on risk analysis and test data.
		</p>

		<h3>Scope and Limitations</h3>
		<p>The initial focus of the project has been set developing a single use case in a small freshwater aquarium with limited instruments, as outlined in the aims. While this leaves much room for expansion, due to the lack of relevant experience within the team, it was decided to restrict the focus to ensure enough time is committed to developing the fundamentals and that resources aren’t wasted on tasks lacking a clearly defined ultimate implantation. Development of these secondary features could be considered only after all core components have been successfully developed.
		</p><p>The lack of experience within the team also creates a few key limitations for developing the project. The limited programming experience within the team currently makes it impossible to properly develop the actual software for the hub or app beyond wireframes and ‘click-throughs’. The actual physical components will most likely require input from a 3rd party as the group entirely lacks the skills and tools required for the resourcing, physical construction, and interfacing of all the various components.
		</p><p>Certain aspects like procuring information to fill out the encyclopaedia and tutorials would also require much deeper research and possibly licensing issues etc.
		</p>

		<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
		<h4>LucidChart</h4>
		<p>LucidChart’s software was used initially to create a wireframe UI for the application so as to demonstrate and sketch out capabilities. Tyson has previous experience with the application through previous projects. The license for the software is competitive compared to alternatives.
		</p>
		<h4>GitHub</h4>
		<p>GitHub is used as a collaboration software for the team aspects of the project. As the team all had previous experience it was chosen for this project. The enterprise license is well priced considering the vast functionality.
		</p>
		<h4>Figma</h4>
		<p>Figma is an application demonstration software that Tyson had previous experience using. Though the Organisation is among the more costly options, we chose Figma for its intuitive functionality over alternatives.
		</p>
		<h4>iMovie</h4>
		<p>iMovie is a video editing suite used for our video presentation. The free software from Apple is simple to use and suited our needs nicely. Other alternatives such as Final Cut are expensive and contain unnecessary functionality.
		</p>

		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>Stage 1 testing is pretty simple: Sensors: Temperature, Lights; we can test these with a simple thermometer and using our eyes. We will need to test for electrical leaks in the tank, tester to wear thick rubber gloves such as welding gloves while going over the tank with a multi-metre.
