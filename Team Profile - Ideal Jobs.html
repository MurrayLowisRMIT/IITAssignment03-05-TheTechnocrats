	<h1>Team Profile - Ideal Jobs</h1>
	
	<h2>Joe</h1>
	
	<p>I was unable to find any job adverts online that were remotely like my ideal job, so I created a fictional job advert for a real company:

		Captiv iOS developer ad (fake)
		Captiv. Captiv is a small French company of 11 people (or at least that's the Gaspard team) making IT products, including for the disability services market. It's products include a sensor mat for wheelchairs that communicates with an iPhone to warn when you are in danger of developing a bedsore and 5 other functions (called Gaspard) and an temperature/humidity/pressure sensor that communicates with your iPhone.

		Position: Captiv is looking for experienced iOS Mobile Devs with a passion for quality, a passion for innovation, and a passion to learn. You would be working on our Gaspard product. This is my ideal job as my desire is to work making life richer for people with disabilities.

		A few years experience with iOS and programming in Swift. You must be able to demonstrate several iOS apps you have written. The ideal applicant will have fluent French. Some experience in engineering and web design would be a bonus.

		I have basic French (formerly intermediate) and several months experience writing apps for iOS in Swift. I have 89% of an engineering degree and basic web design capabilities. I'm practicing my French once a week with a friend and at some point I'll take a 2 week holiday to Vanuatu for an immersive French experience once my French is good enough (it involves staying with a family who don't speak English and is subsidised by the French government).

		I plan on taking the iPhone Software Engineering elective as part of my Bachelor of IT, as well as Further Programming, Programming Principles 2A and Object-Oriented Programming in C++, and taking UNIX System Administration as a free elective and a 2nd semester French subject as my other elective. I plan on working on making some abandonware games accessible to people with disabilities as well as making them available to modern OSs, MacOS, iOS, Windows and Linux, as projects while I complete my degree.</p>

	<p>http://www.belmores.com.au/files/docs/financial%20planner.pdf This position is for a financial planner who helps people generally of older ages prepare and build savings for retirement, as well as assist with younger families with things such as budgeting and superannuation. This is appealing to me as it is the profession I am looking to go into once I complete my bachelor’s degree in business and financial planning. Ideally to get to this position I would need some years experience in the financial planning field and also be able to help the business grow with new business. Currently I am working as a paraplanner in a financial planning firm and have been for 3 years. I have no other experience which is why I am studying in order to gain knowledge towards my goal. I am currently studying part time and have 4 years of part time study left. I plan to keep working in and around the financial planning field as a paraplanner and also continue my studies and therefore once completed my degree I will have a large amount of experience and hopefully be much more employable than another graduate with little to no eperience.</p>

		https://www.seek.com.au/job/50104621?type=standard#searchRequestToken=43f85981-b008-4663-942b-755c89acaf36

		This is an example of a software engineer job listing with a tech company specialising in customised software for its clients. In addition to producing and marketing their own software they also provide ongoing support with onboarding and rolling out updates based on client feedback. The role itself requires familiarity with several programming languages, and the ability to interact constructively with both clients and colleagues, to identify ways to improve their product.

		The role interests me as it sounds like it will allow a degree of creative freedom in software design. A set list of outcomes is provided by the company itself or by a client, a general set of programming guidelines is set out for streamlining integration with the work of others, otherwise the design approach is at the discretion of the software engineer. Creative freedom is one of the things I am most interested in when it comes to advancing my IT career and as such this could be a fitting role.

		This role would require developing fluency in a range of programming languages as a starting point, and the drive to continue exploring them and developing smarter solutions. It also requires the ability to communicate constructively with clients and colleagues to figure out new ways to improve their product.
		
		Experience from my education and previous career in engineering/project management gives me a good starting point for the requisite communication skills for this role. My previous communication experience however has been more tailored towards conveying information rather than a two-way exchange. I will need to continue to build and use receptive communication skills to meet the requirements of such a position. Naturally, this position would also require a great deal of study into programming languages and techniques. I hope to further build on both skill groups through course material and cooperative group work within this course, as well as over the course of any undergraduate and post-graduate work experience. Short term undergraduate work, casual work or even freelance projects could also help provide experience to bolster my application.</p>

	<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/50055762?type=standard#searchRequestToken=3158af8e-bac8-449e-b9a3-a2d33abe4a82 Based on a good amount of customer service-related roles I have enjoyed in the past I would like to take my experience and expertise with me into my IT career. Given a solid understanding of the IT world I believe I would greatly enjoy a role such as this one. To work directly with customers or clients with tech issues and to solve problems and help people I believe would be a very rewarding experience. This role is a desktop and application support position in which they are looking for an applicant to maintain and manage any IT related issues that come forth. They have a very large team at their head office (I used to work for the company and went there for numerous reasons during my tenure) and they require someone to join their small team of Level 2 IT support specialists to oversee their computing operation in house as well as remote support to the numerous chain businesses all over South Australia. I recall the software they used for their POS was very prone to issues so I can see their crucial need for IT staff. This type of role is extremely interesting to me as someone who enjoys working in a team, enjoys helping people and enjoys solving problems. This particular company has been known to aggressively expand so opportunities for consultation and computing setup in the various stores is very likely an additional duty that would present itself from time to time. For this position they require tertiary qualifications or adequate experience in a similar role. They find knowledge in the Microsoft programs such as Outlook, PowerPoint, Word etc. to be very advantageous as well as knowledge of cloud computing. They expect basic knowledge of IP networking and printer setups. I have a relatively firm grasp on most of the Office suit of programs however I fall short on all the other particulars. My plan is to reach beyond an area of basic competency in these aspects to thrive in a position such as this one. Of most of those requirements, I hope to achieve them within the material of this course. As of now I am unsure on how I would go about achieving a great understanding of printer setups and how they work outside of the software that governs it. There are a few resources available online that would help get me there such as this one. https://computer.howstuffworks.com/inkjet-printer.htm I am also unsure of whether this would classify as an entry level position or not. The option between relevant experience or tertiary education tells me that knowledge of these languages and software could potentially mark one as a successful candidate. If that is true than I may find myself applying for a job such as this with just a couple of years of this bachelor under my belt.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Torin</h1>
	
	<p>The job listing I found was for Technology Lead with an SaaS company on the Gold Coast. The position calls for someone who has 10 years of experience in Software Development, with management experience to match. The role involves several programs which will likely be utilised as work commences. These include AWS, PHP, Java and React. The succesful applicant must have experience with a "start-up" or similar business venture. On top of the technical and managerial skills, they must have an artistic flair, as the position will involve making decisions concerned with design and architecture.

		Currently my experience is limited to cursory studies in coding and graphic design. Neither of these are accredited by any institution and my experience is less than two years in each of the fields.

		To follow the path of this career I would need to continue my study to attain a Bachelor of IT from RMIT, in which time I would hope to network with some career professionals and attain an entry level position in a start-up endeavour. After staying with a particular company for a number of years, I would progress to Tech Lead, a promotion I would keep for a minimum of 10 years. During this time, I would hone my skills and gather experience in hands-on coding, design and team management. After this time, I will have accrued enough knowledge to approach the technology job market with a pragmatic and holistic approach, which this role requires.</p>
