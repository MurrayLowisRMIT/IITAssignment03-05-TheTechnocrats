			</div>
			<p>I first became interested in programming when I had to do an assignment on BASIC in year 9 in high school, which led to my talking my parents into buying me a Dick Smith System 80 with 16kB RAM and an audio tape drive. I started programming in BASIC on it, writing various games and working on one in particular that helped me learn about subroutines.
			</p><p>In 1982 I finished a year student exchange program in the USA where I studied BASIC and got 100%. I did a course in Pascal in 1983 and started a degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS, then the NSW Institute of Technology) in 1984 where I learned Fortran and dabbled in some other programming languages (Ratfor, Z80 Assembly code, Forth). I had to withdraw from the course before I finished. In 2010 I had another go at Mechanical Engineering, at Sydney University this time. In first semester I did Engineering Computing which covered Matlab. September last year I had to withdraw from the course having completed 89% of it. I have some experience in HTML and had a web site which made use of HTML and CSS but that is gone now. I also started a course on Udemy in writing applications for iOS, but I didn't complete it as I prioritised my university studies.

			<h2>Marcus</h2>
			<h3>student ID: S3735636</h3>
			<div class="side left">
				<img src="Images/Marcus2.png">
			</div>
			<p>I am a 22-year-old who has little interest in IT, with no experience whatsoever. I love video games; I recently built my own gaming PC and I like to work out how things fit together. However, that is as far as my knowledge goes. My family used to have one desktop computer that we could use for 30 minutes each a day, and whenever the phone rang it would cut the internet! The career I am pursuing has very little IT related skills necessary, I would not normally do a subject such as this however my business course requires it. In saying that, I have learnt a lot from this subject that I may be able to apply in my further studies as well as my career. My main hobbies include sports such as basketball, footy and video games.

			<h2>Murray</h2>
			<h3>student ID: S3862651</h3>
			<div class="side right">
				<img src="Images/Murray.jpg">
			</div>
			<p>My IT experience prior to this course has been mostly from simply playing around with my own computers and gadgets and doing some free online programming courses. When it comes to the technology I use, I like to explore and test everything I can, whether it be learning new programs or trying new ways to use gadgets. For instance, streaming my computer to the living room then using a Bluetooth PS4 controller with 3rd party software to watch Netflix, or myriad other token exercises. For me, half the fun is seeing if I can do it.

			<h2>Ossama</h2>
			<h3>student ID: S3868543</h3>
			<div class="side left">
				<img src="Images/Ossama.jpg">
			</div>
			<p>I have always been interested in computing technology for as long as I can remember. Growing up we always had a computer in the house, and I found myself being the go-to person for technology related issues. As time went on and I developed an interest in gaming my competence within computing also expanded as a result. I am nowhere near adept in the area, but my interest and desired career naturally line up as a result.

			<h2>Torin</h2>
			<h3>student ID: S3863563</h3>
			<div class="side right">
				<img src="Images/Torin.jpg">
			</div>
			<p>My interest in IT goes back to some of my earliest memories at home. I remember our old dial-up connection beeping away, taking so long to produce even an image. LimeWire and Torrents came next, accidentally downloading viruses onto the family computer, while only trying to get a few songs on my 512mb mp3 player. At the local Trash & Treasure I would often find old computers to take apart and check out their insides. Removing the fans to connect to 9v batteries was always exciting. Later in life I found an interest in graphic design, sound engineering and a small amount of coding through internet courses. The graphic design was a creative outlet for me, as my pen to paper art skills are sub-par at best. My interest in live sound led me to connect two of my passions, technology, and music. Most recently, I have begun to delve into the world of coding, which brought me to this course.

			<h2>Tyson</h2>
			<h3>student ID: S3756051</h3>
			<div class="side left">
				<img src="Images/Tyson.jpg">
			</div>
			<p>I have always had a passion for computers and IT in general, I never took a traditional path but even in my career working in Building Services I found a way to utilize my passion for technology and have ended up working in building technology. Over the last 12 years I have been able to take a start as an apprentice to now leading a global team for Siemens as a digital expert. In building technology you have a need for varying skills, you start with the building services, understand how a building works and how its controlled. Once you have a foundation of understanding you can begin installing the automation system, this is installing hardware and sensing equipment throughout a building to control all the mechanical systems. It requires a level of knowledge for programming, electrical wiring, and networking. The programming and networking are the same as a typical computer system and very transferable skills.
			</p><p>It is clear to me that I am not a traditional learner, I can be very creative but also doing standard book learning exercises is not my ideal method. I work well in teams and can be very inclusive and attentive to others’ needs.
			</p><p>I really can work with most groups and can be a good leader or follower, I am good communicator and can bring people along the journey.
			</p><p>A group should form with different personalities and mixing the workload to fit each person. Being inclusive and understanding of skills and preferred tasks will be critical to success.

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Marcus was a bit of the odd one out in terms of IT experience, the rest of the team having some IT experience in software and/or hardware. Torin proved his own with his film-making skills in Assessment 5, the video production. Over all the combination of skills represented served the team well, although the combination of software skills available between Joe, Murray, Tyson and Ossama to some extent will serve us better in the development of this project beyond what we will be submitting for Assessment 3 and into the development phase.

			<h1>Group Processes</h1>
			<p>For assignment 2 our group took a couple of weeks to come together and coordinate before we could make a meaningful start and we encountered several issues impeding progression. We used the below solutions (often in an ad hoc manner) to get assignment 2 across the line:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Used canvas for initial discussion before moving to MS Teams
				</p><li><p>Files generally uploaded directly to MS Teams for a single member to upload to GitHub and incorporate into report
				</p><li><p>Unstructured irregular meetings
				</p><li><p>Relied up on direct messaging often making it difficult to reach team members
				</p><li><p>Work was conducted mostly independently. Sections were split between members with little interaction, generally needing a high degree of editing/formatting to unify sections into ultimate report
				</p>
			</ul>
			<p>For assignments 3 and 5 we applied the lessons we learnt from Assignment 2, building upon and adding to these methods after gauging what worked and where we needed to improve. We ended up implementing the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Used MS Teams voice chat and screen sharing abilities in addition to text chat. This made individual input more recognisable and made for a more inviting forum to discuss ideas and problems. The visual interactivity made it much easier to convey ideas, helped improve group relations and fostered cooperation
				</p><li><p>Our team worked together to understand the GitHub app and learn to update repository independently
				</p><li><p>Rich text files (such as the main report) were stored on MS Teams while under construction. This allowed multiple members to edit the report simultaneously and avoided clashes with pushes to GitHub. Keeping the report body on MS Teams’ made it very easy to discuss as all members could view and edit the report live. We also conducted polls in an MS Excel file using this method
				</p><li><p>A template report was created at the very beginning and sections were colour coordinated for each member’s contributions/requirements. This made sure no confusion arose as to allocation of responsibilities, allowing members to easily identify what needed to be done and in what timeframe. It also allowed us to monitor progress
				</p><li><p>Regularly scheduled meetings twice per week kept members up to date with the changing scope of the project and prevented conflict between sections
				</p><li><p>Established group accord to regularly check MS Teams for updates/member questions. Members often posted questions and received prompt responses helping to mitigate bottle necking
				</p><li><p>Report guidelines laid out early based on the final state of assignment 2. This included general formatting, writing style, and referencing techniques used by all members
				</p><li><p>Created a ‘member contribution’ text file accessible by all members. This was used to capture member contributions that could not be reflected by the GitHub commit trail
				</p>
			</ul>

			<h2>Joe</h2>
			<p>In Assignment 2 I said I was hoping to work as a software developer for a company that has products to help people with disabilities, and this hasn’t changed. I would also be interested in working for a non-profit organisation such as a church or a para-church organisation, something helping with the environment or a social justice non-profit or something similar, although with the economy being the way it is I way just have to take anything I can get, although being on the disability pension I can be more choosy than many people doing this course. I don’t have to work.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Marcus</h2>
			<p>In Assignment 2 I stated that a job in the financial planning industry is my ideal career. This statement has not changed at all. While completing this subject, I have certainly discovered that I am not suited to a job in the IT field and I still believe that the financial planning role I mentioned in Assignment 2 would suit me best. This is due to the creative aspect of IT and technical skills that I have no interest in. I like the rules and regulations around the financial industry, and I like having structure. I also currently work in the financial industry and know it is the role for me.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Murray</h2>
			<p>In previous assignments I stated that I am interested in programming and cybersecurity as potential careers. Time spent in the ‘Introduction to Programming’ course has reinforced this opinion as I find myself very much enjoying the creative problem-solving skills it utilises. The main attribute that I am looking for in a career is at least some degree of creative freedom, which I believe would be attainable as a software engineer, though cybersecurity may offer more in the way of day to day variety.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Ossama</h2>
			<p>As previously mentioned in both assignments my ideal job has been to work in customer service and this assertion has not changed thus far. As I am being exposed to the wide world of Information Technology my desire to keep my career goals attainable and my future ambiguous still seems like my best course of action. This field of IT is still my first recommendation and is still a good steppingstone toward a career in IT.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Torin</h2>
			<p>Throughout the weeks, after submitting Assignment 2, I have had time to contemplate my place within the IT community and whether it reflects my ideal career scenario. Without a doubt, this course has been a humbling experience, though my ideal career hasn’t shifted. In fact, gaining experience with online communication tools has made my vision for the future more accessible. The skills I've been learning are ultimately pushing me toward my original goal.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Tyson</h2>
			<p>During this course I have found a reaffirming of my passions and what job interests me the most. My ideal job is based around creating a digital blueprint for a business to collect, understand, utilize large amounts of data to enrich the decision-making process. I am passionate about this and completing this course is only reinforcing my belief.
			</p><p>The specific job I previously found is based around bring business units together under one goal of data transparency. It is a complete process for a digitalization overhaul, working from design to implementation and ongoing management. It would be a very technical role but mixed with a large change management process. You would need to convince many parties of the benefit, create a solution that can be utilized across divisions and then implement the value of having data from all divisions using analytics.
			</p><p>I am interested in this role because it lends to my existing skill set, future skills I am currently building but most importantly my interest in Digitalization.
			</p><p>The following experience is required:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Executive level exposure, on sales, reporting and management</p>
				</p><li><p>Design, development and validation experience on a digitalization strategy with analytics
				</p><li><p>Engineering and Integration experience with cloud solutions like AWS/Azure with analytics roll out, including on-prem to cloud solutions
				</p><li><p>Creating a comprehensive and clear communication message to work with a diverse set of team members
				</p>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>There are some similarities in our ideal jobs that are quite apparent while other jobs contain similar elements if nothing else. Our desired branches of IT contain business, software, customer support and even finance. Although these workplace sectors can seem worlds apart the beauty of Information Technology allows for diverse opportunities for people involved with IT.
			</p><p>Out of the 6 of us sharing this project almost all of us have significant similarities with at least 1 other member between our desired jobs. Murray, Joe and Torin are all seeking a career in software development albeit in differing facets. Marcus, Tyson and Ossama are all interested in combining IT with business in some form or another. Marcus being inclined to use IT within the world of finance and Tyson with data analysis and retrieval. Ossama on the other hand wishes to use his IT experience alongside his customer service experience in a helpdesk or service role.
			</p><p>Expected in software development is a hefty amount of programming which is likely not what Ossama, Tyson or Marcus will be employing. It is more probable they will be using software developed by programming inclined employees such as Torin, Murray and Joe. Customer service will be front and centre for Ossama and Marcus which is a skill the other four are likely to never need.
			</p><p>After receiving our feedback from assessment 2 it seems that our desired individual career paths have mostly stayed the same. The opportunity of getting familiar with the IT industry and beginning to understand the likely job responsibilities has seemingly emboldened our resolve to follow in our pre-determined career paths. Aptly put by Torin, “Without a doubt, this course has been a humbling experience”, is an accurate summary of most of our opinions as we close out our first IT subject. Getting familiar with the kinds of applications such as Microsoft Teams and GitHub has revealed to us the immense knowledge, we have yet to possess to achieve our career goals. GitHub being the epitome of a complex and time-consuming starting point, which is a process of learning we will have to become accustomed to.
