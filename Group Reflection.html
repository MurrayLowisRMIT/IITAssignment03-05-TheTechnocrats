			<h2>Joe</h2>
			<p>We worked well together on the whole. There was a spirit of cooperation that helped us get through the times when there were difficulties with communication. Not everyone was able to contribute to group discussions and the group chat in Teams equally, with those who are working having more limited time to do so. On some occasions we would be asking questions of Tyson or Torin that were not answered quickly, particularly just after the submission of Assessment 2.
			</p><p>Our initial process for working on the Report proved to be inadequate as some people wrote over other people’s contributions and Murray had to go back through the commits and merge the work of two people, so we changed to working on a live version of the Report which constantly saved changes as they were made. A lot of decisions were made by voting (meeting times, team name, product name) and this worked well although sometimes we were waiting a while for the contribution of some members to the vote.
			</p><p>My most significant contributions are to the Testing and Risks section of the report, and also to some of the summaries of sections with contributions from all of us. Something I learned about teamwork is that being on the same page about your objectives and having some goodwill can overcome a lot of difficulties. Also having a sense of humour helped us and diffused what could have been tense otherwise

			<h2>Marcus</h2>
			<p>Throughout the project for assignments 2,3 & 5 the Technocrats as a team worked well together. Towards the end of the subject and as assignments grew more important, the team banded together and met regularly to assign tasks, discuss individual problems and concerns and to interchange ideas. The use of teams as the hub of our discussions worked well also. At the beginning, meeting times we often missed and we as a team lacked structure in terms of communicating. This was rectified towards the end of assignment 2 and from then on, we knew what worked for each other and what didn’t. For Assignment 3 I focused on the “Skills & Jobs” section in order to outline job descriptions that outline the expertise and skills that a manager leading this project may look for in potential employees. Team assignments require all members to give adequate input to be successful, which I have gained a better understanding of throughout this subject.
			</p><p>Some things I found surprising about my teammates are:
			</p><p>Murray’s leadership qualities and knowledge around the IT systems was particularly surprising to me as this is an introductory subject. This was extremely helpful for the group.
			</p><p>Ossama’s preference to work in customer support was surprising to me at first, as people with interest in IT are generally introverted and reserved. However, through the team meetings I realised that Ossama, although having a strong interest in IT, is quite outgoing and well-spoken which will serve him well in his future endeavours.
			</p><p>Torin’s capabilities behind a camera were beneficial to the group as he took charge of Assignment 5. Also, like Ossama, Torin was well spoken throughout the team discussions which helped the team to gel together and put our best foot forward.
			</p><p>Joe’s overall experience within the IT field seemed to be superior to the rest of the team which made Joe, along with Murray, able to oversee parts of the project and have significant input which made our project exponentially more advanced.
			</p><p>Tyson is living and working outside of Australia which was surprising, however his IT skills were also surprising with how well he was able to contribute within the group. His ability to work around his work and attend many of the meetings within work hours was impressive.
			</P>

			<h2>Murray</h2>
			<p>Having worked together over several weeks to complete three assignments, I think we as The Technocrats performed relatively well as a team and made effective use of our broad (though still developing) collective skillset. While a bit slow to coordinate initially, once we came to understand each other’s strengths we managed to coordinate tasks, allocate roles, and get to work. After this we had few issues in the way of member contribution with each completing their own workload and coordinating well for the collaborative sections. Once we got going our communication was effective and we managed to work through each problem as they arose.
			</p><p>My personal input to the actual report consisted of detailing the aims and scope as well as collating the other members contributions into the ‘Plans and Progress’ section. I also handled the final editing at the end of the project which included proof-reading, editing, formatting and unifying the whole report as well as writing up some of summary sections (such as the GitHub commit trail/member contribution audit which needed the holistic retrospective that comes with the editing process).
			</p><p>I would say the two greatest problems we faced as a group were the often-slow response times earlier in the project and effectively conveying individual member responsibilities to avoid conflict/omissions within the writeup. We learnt from mistakes in assignment 2 however and avoided many such issues this time around with our regular casual meetings to go over progress and concerns.
			</p><p>As for things I found surprising about the team after working together on this project:
			</p><p>Joe’s pre-existing knowledge of IT is significantly higher than I would expect from someone only just now starting an introductory course.
			</p><p>I think Marcus’ attitude generally matches the result of his Myers-Briggs test from assignment 1 in that he is quite practically orientated. I found it interesting for someone so pragmatic to have an interest in a subject as fanciful as IT.
			</p><p>Ossama’s interest in IT seems to be more in the way of social engagement/client support which I think would have to be an uncommon attitude in an industry stereotypically populated by more reclusive personalities.
			</p><p>Torin was able to fill a niche that we may otherwise have struggled to fill, enthusiastically applying his multimedia skills when working on the accompanying Assignment 5 presentation.
			</p><p>Tyson’s time management and ability to coordinate with the group was quite impressive given that he lives in a time zone 8 hours behind the rest of us and regularly had to check in with the group during his daytime working hours.
			</P>

			<h2>Ossama</h2>
			<p>After previously working together in the prior assignment and discovering each other’s strengths and weaknesses, I felt that we had confidence as a group to see this project plan through to a highly researched and well thought out state. The project idea was great to begin with, but the input each of us made toward the end of the assignment period gave this project life. At first, we were unsure about how to distribute the responsibilities and turn one man’s idea into a fruitful and coherent group project, but as time went on and Murray’s leadership began to positively assert itself, the desired structure had taken root.
			</p><p>With Murray at the helm, organising meeting times and encouraging group thinking, I believe we were able to maximise one another’s talents for use in this venture. I, as an often-holistic thinking kind of person, was put in charge of the overview while Tyson’s creative flair was utilized in the project artefacts. Joe has proven himself as one of the most impressive researchers and thus was put in charge of testing and risks. Marcus’ interest in the business side of IT had him researching roles and Torin’s outgoing disposition made him the perfect candidate for the ‘Infomercial Style’ video presentation found in assessment 5. At the conclusion of this assessment, I feel confident that all members of this group will find success entering the IT industry in future.			</P>

			<h2>Torin</h2>
			<p>Throughout the duration of the project each team member showed their strengths in different areas, centred around their individual tasks. While we took some time to find a balance of communication, we each worked well on our own parts. As the weeks continued and each member became more confident in their roles, the collaboration became more effective.
			</p><p>My contribution to the project was focussed on the Timeframe and Tools & Technologies section. Each had their own difficulties and though I was tested for each the group communication helped me finish them to the best of my abilities and the team’s vision. The Timeframe section was particularly challenging. Having to map out the next steps in our project effort while difficult, gave me an idea of how to look into the future of a project and define roles and expectations immediately. The video project allowed me to incorporate some creativity and presentation skill development.
			</p><p>Murray surprised me with his composure as our defacto leader in times of stress. Coupled with his big picture view of the project it made the project all the easier.
			</p><p>Marcus was a helpful addition to the team with his definitions of the aims and overview of the project. It gave us the framework upon which we built the project.
			</p><p>Joe’s in-depth research of the competitors and costings analysis was highly informative and gave the group and idea of where we stood, in relation to the market. His risk and testing research demonstrated an understanding of the project and its impacts.
			</p><p>Tyson’s skill with wireframes and demo software was a highly helpful addition to the project. He was able to explain the software and how it was implemented, in ways we all could understand.
			</p><p>Ossama’s consisted communication with the group and additions to the report was a crucial element to the group’s success. His solidification of the group’s goal was very helpful and his knowledge of 80s classic kept group morale high.

			<h2>Tyson</h2>
			<p>This course has really highlighted the requirements for working well in a group, we had strong leadership by Murray from the start and with consistent communication we were able to keep on top of our tasks, when submitting assignment 2 we found that the workload was distributed well but more communication was required. Throughout this project we were able to work through any issues with a positive attitude and humour, overall it's been a very enjoyable project and the last 3 weeks we have really found our stride working together and produced what I perceive to be a fantastic result.
			</p><p>My contribution to the project was focussed on the wireframes and project prototype, the two artefacts with some report writing. I have done work in this area before but with different tools and not anything close to what we were trying to achieve with this project. I found that working closely with Murray our team leader was critical as the project was his idea, it took many versions to get the result we were looking for but in the end the prototype was a successful finished solution. As I am based in Switzerland, the team was very understanding of my time zone issues and we always found a way to communicate even if at some stages we had delays in response.
			</p><p>Murray from day 1 showed strong leadership attributes and led the team day to day, he really kept all the team on track and motivated but also led by example completing all the work on schedule and to a high level of quality.
			</p><p>Marcus was a strong team member, able to solve any task given to him and always happy to fill any role required, he became critical to tackle large parts of the project report.
			</p><p>Joe’s level of research on competitors and risk was very impressive. Throughout the course Joe conducted himself with a high level of professionalism and was the most consistent member in terms of communication and task completion.
			</p><p>Torin’s creative flair was shown during this course, he took many tasks with an upbeat attitude and really carried the team with the presentation part of our assignment, I was very impressed with the end results and the level of investment he put into the project.
			</p><p>Ossama is a positive influence on the team, always available, always willing to complete any task and keep the team's moral at a high. He was a workhorse throughout the course and always took on more tasks then asked of him.
			</P>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>As people have observed the team got off to a shaky start in terms of communication and contribution at the end of Assessment 2, but Murray took on the leadership role and continued to prompt and encourage people and improve our procedures using Teams to communicate and share files, and at the end everyone has come together to make this report and assignment what it is.
			</p><p>As the Project Contribution Tracking document shows, Murray and Joe were contributing from 11/8/20, Ossama first comes in on 14/8/20, Tyson 18/8/20, Torin 20/8/20 and Marcus doesn’t appear in that document because he didn’t document his contribution. This document isn’t the whole story, though, as Marcus has made significant contributions to this report, particularly in the skills and jobs section, while Joe submitted a lot of small contributions.
			</p><p>One way we kept track of who was doing what and what needed to be done was by colour coding the report, with each contributor’s sections in a different colour. The large amount of each colour in the report showed the significant contributions everyone had made. Also, Tyson came up with the mock-up of the web application on a mobile device and Torin developed the video of the ad as well as doing the Timeframe and Tools and Tech components.
			</p><p>We demonstrated that effective means of communication, a bit of leadership and encouragement and some good will, along with a sense of humour goes a long way.
